            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Iian Kehn, I work at Amazon, and I am passionate about technology.</p>
            <p>I've been creating content for over a decade and writing about it for over 15 years. I am a technology enthusiast, and I love tinkering with servers, code, and whatever I can get my hands on.</p>
            <p>Here are the current projects I am working on</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Dev Note</li>
                <li>FreedomRaio</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Dev Note</h3>
            <p>The Dev Note is a wiki for IT professionals, enthusiasts, and prosumers. It is a wealth of knowledge featuring process guides, how-to's and best practices.</p>
            <p>The project began during the pandemic as Sevan Learning, it was pulled due to lack of content. It has been under development for the past 4 years and will be launching later this year as The Dev Note Wiki. It is not yet available for public preview, but will be coming in the next few months.</p>
            <h3>FreedomRadio</h3>
            <p>FreedomRadio is the oldest remaining project from Sevan/World of Sevan. It is primarily a playlist driven network of music on <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/iiankehn">Apple Music</a>. Playlists range from Rock to Hip-Hop and in between. It is constantly being updated, so be sure to add it to your collection.</p>
